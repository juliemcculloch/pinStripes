			<h1>Pinstripes</h1>
			<h2>definition:</h2>
			<p>Pinstripes are a pattern of very thin stripes of any color running in parallel. The pinstriped suit has become associated with conservative business attire, although many designers now produce the fashionable pinstripe patterns for fashion-conscious consumers. Pinstripes, stripes or fine lines are used in all forms of art. Pinstripe backgrounds in websites are a great way of adding a textured pattern to a plain background.</p>
